# DKSLearn01

## Project Purpose

A learning project to practice modern web development with HTML, React, and Git workflows.

## What We're Building

- `index.html` — a simple HTML page
- A **Banner component** built in React, embedded in the HTML page

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3
- React (loaded via CDN, no build step initially)
- Git + GitHub for version control

## Project Structure

├── CLAUDE.md        ← you are here
├── index.html       ← main page
└── components/
    └── Banner.jsx   ← React banner component
```

## Learning Goals

- Understand how React components work
- Embed React in a plain HTML page (no bundler)
- Practice Git init → commit → push to GitHub workflow

## Conventions

- Use semantic HTML
- Keep components small and focused
- Commit messages in present tense: "Add banner component"

## Status

🚧 In progress — initializing project
